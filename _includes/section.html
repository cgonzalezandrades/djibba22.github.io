  <h1 class="lucida">This is my cool blog I have created to document my projects at Full Sail University</h1>
  <p class="lucida">I will update the site as I move through the program and put down my processes and opinions of each class and all of the great experiences as I complete and earn my degree. It should be fun and helpful down the road to have a reference and to watch my growth.<p>
