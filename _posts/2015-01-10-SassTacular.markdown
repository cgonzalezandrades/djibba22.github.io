# My Latest ACtivities
## So today I have discovered how to declare my variables in SCSS. I have realized how to commit and push with the terminal using command line. I have learned a little about how SASS uses file structure and compiling the CSS. I have used includes and learned how to properly add new posts. I have learned  quite a bit but I am excited to learn more about jekyll and how i can take advantage of this new tech. I have decided to try and use the terminal. I have used  small amount of mixins but I am excited for that as well. add some text
