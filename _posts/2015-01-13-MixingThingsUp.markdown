# My Battles with Mixins
## First of all, mixins are powerful I can see. They are a little confusing at first with just a few classes in my file, but I can see how these will be useful later when my project is full of elements. The first big question that I had working with mixins is the variable to be passed in. I have also found difficulty in nesting styles inside of my mixins. I will do further reasearch to see what I had wrong or if it is just noe possible. I have things working pretty good. I have a much better understanding of mixins and how they work. I have looked it up nad there is no way to nest styles within a mixin.
