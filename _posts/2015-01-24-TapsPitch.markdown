#The Official pitch
My pitch to re-working the marketing site for TAPS beer, wine and eatery is fairly simple. I would like for the company to maintain a better web-presence. The poor representation that exists at this time can be changed and should be changed. The basic site layout and the page structure is where I will start. The content containing the poor images and the non-existent imformative text, is on the list in second. The site can bring important information about the resteraunt to patrons that are looking ahed to the evening at the Winter Park Village.
