#The benefits of Analytics
 I did some research on analytics and what I found was actually very interesting. I read about things like sessions and pageviews. I see now that these are important things that provide vital data when you are developing an app or website. When you know the amount of page views you can see what kind of traffic you are obtaining on your site. I read about things like dimensions and metrics. Dimensions are things like session duration and page exits and these are defaulted in google analytics. I also learned about metrics.Screenviews,pages/session, session average are all metrics. I have set up analytics on my jekyll site and ran some experimental hits for feedback and I have to say it is serious fun.
