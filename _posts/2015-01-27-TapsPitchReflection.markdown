#The reflection of my pitch
My pitch was good as far as the delivery. This is how I felt that it went. I think that the idea and the plan were accepted well acroos the class. I have tons of work to do as far as getting past chellenges. It wiil be challenging to actually get a look and feel that I have targeted for the project. There are some things that should be fairly easy and some that are going to take some research. I have since found out that the company actually has a a nice website at a different url.
I don't think it is impossible to create a great project but it will be difficult for me to make a very nice look and feel in this program jekyll.
