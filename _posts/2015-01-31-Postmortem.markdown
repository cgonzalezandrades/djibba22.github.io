#My post mortem reflection
In my reflection of this months project, I would first think of all the new things I learned. I had trouble making fantastic project because I was learning on-the-fly about so many new things such as
markdown and jekyll's framework structure. I decided this month would be the last time I used the git-hub GUI. I had no trouble picking up command line procedure with terminal. I did however, not understand the many commands that were need for diferent tasks. Overall, I did like the jekyll project and I will be putting up a polished project as soon as possible. I will either have a blog or I may just have a portfolio running on gh-pages. I really enjoyed the class and the project. I think that execution was a little shy of a truly polished deployment but the concepts were implemented and I am very happy with that respect.
