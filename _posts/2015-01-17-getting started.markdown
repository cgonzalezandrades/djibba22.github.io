# Getting started on my Marketing Website
I plan on re-working the website for http://tapswinterpark.com. The first part of my research will be to go and visit the establishment. I will eat the food and have a beer. I can then discuss the site and their branding with the employees and hopefully the owner. I have to see the establishment and the environment to even understad what the site would need and the kind of features that it would benefit from.
