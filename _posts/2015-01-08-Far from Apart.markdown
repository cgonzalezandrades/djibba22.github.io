# Yes that is a reference to the famous blog "A list Apart"
## This is not a real blog like a list apart but if you want a real good blog to read go to a list apart.
### This is one of my first posts in my blog for a scholastic diary. As I go through my education at full sail I will blog about my experiences and projects as I go. This hsoould make for a great blog that could be useful for others to read and enjoy.
